I was a teaching assistant for a graduate-level class, BIODS215: Topics in Biomedical Data Science, Large-scale inference. I taught a section on "Reproducible large-scale inference", hosted office hours, maintained [the class website](https://biods215.github.io/class_website/2018.html), and graded the assignments.
