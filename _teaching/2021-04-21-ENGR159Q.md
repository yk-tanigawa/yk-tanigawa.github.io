I have been fortunate to give a guest lecture for "Japanese Companies and Japanese Society" (ENGR159Q) taughed by Prof. Robert Sinclair during my time at Stanford.

In this discussion-based class, I introduced an overview of the education system in Japan and provided some materials for discussion (see the attached image for the summary of the materials covered in the class).
