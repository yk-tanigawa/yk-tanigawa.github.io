Yosuke Tanigawa is a Postdoctoral Associate at [MIT Computational Biology Lab](http://compbio.mit.edu/) (PI: [Dr. Manolis Kellis](https://web.mit.edu/manoli/)). His research interests are in various topics in population genomics, specifically focusing on the analysis of large-scale datasets.

He completed his doctoral training at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) (Ph.D. in [Biomedical Informatics](https://med.stanford.edu/bmi.html)), where he worked with [Dr. Manuel Rivas](http://med.stanford.edu/rivaslab/) and [Dr. Gill Bejerano](http://bejerano.stanford.edu/).

Please check [CV](/cv), [Publications](/publications), and/or [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9hVh3nQAAAAJ&hl=en) for list of publications and pre-prints. Please also check [Resources](/resources) page for datasets, analysis and visualization scripts, and web applications from our research activities (mainly from [the Rivas lab](http://med.stanford.edu/rivaslab/) and [the Bejerano lab](http://bejerano.stanford.edu/)).
