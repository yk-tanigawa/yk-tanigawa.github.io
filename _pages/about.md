Yosuke Tanigawa is a Postdoctoral Associate at [MIT Computational Biology Lab](http://compbio.mit.edu/) (PI: [Dr. Manolis Kellis](https://web.mit.edu/manoli/)). His research interests are in various topics in population genomics, specifically focusing on the analysis of large-scale datasets.

He completed his doctoral training at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) (Ph.D. in [Biomedical Informatics](https://med.stanford.edu/bmi.html)), where he worked with [Dr. Manuel Rivas](http://med.stanford.edu/rivaslab/) and [Dr. Gill Bejerano](http://bejerano.stanford.edu/).

Please check [CV](/cv), [Publications](/publications), and/or [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9hVh3nQAAAAJ&hl=en) for list of publications and pre-prints. Please also check [Resources](/resources) page for datasets, analysis and visualization scripts, and web applications from our research activities (mainly from [the Rivas lab](http://med.stanford.edu/rivaslab/) and [the Bejerano lab](http://bejerano.stanford.edu/)).

## News

- 2022/3/24: **New Publication** "[Significant sparse polygenic risk scores across 813 traits in UK Biobank](/publication/2022-03-24-PRSmap)". We performed a systematic assessment of the predictive performance of polygenic risk score (PRS) models across >1,500 traits in UK Biobank and report 813 PRS models with significant predictive performance.
- 2022/03/02: Yosuke [presented polygenic score analyses at University of Osaka, Japan](/talks/2022-03-02-PRS-UOsaka).
- 2022/01/28: Yosuke [presented at Journal Club meeting at Debora Marks's lab](/talks/2022-01-28-jclub-Marks-lab).
- 2022/01/27: **Updated manuscript**. We posted updated manuscript, titled [Significant Sparse Polygenic Risk Scores across 813 traits in UK Biobank](/publication/preprint-2021-09-06-PRSmap) on medRxiv.
