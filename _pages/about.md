Yosuke Tanigawa is a Ph.D. candidate in [Biomedical Informatics program](https://med.stanford.edu/bmi.html) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). His research interests are in various topics in population genomics, specifically focusing on analysis of large-scale datasets.

He is currently working with [Dr. Manuel Rivas](http://med.stanford.edu/rivaslab/) and [Dr. Gill Bejerano](http://bejerano.stanford.edu/).

Please check [CV](/cv), [Publications](/publications), and/or [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9hVh3nQAAAAJ&hl=en) for list of publications and pre-prints. Please also check [Resources](/resources) page for datasets, analysis and visualization scripts, and web applications from our research activities (mainly from [the Rivas lab](http://med.stanford.edu/rivaslab/) and [the Bejerano lab](http://bejerano.stanford.edu/)).

## News

- 2020/9/1: **New Publication**. ["Sex-specific genetic effects across biomarkers"](/publication/2020-09-01-SEMM). In this study led by [Emily Flynn](https://datascience.stanford.edu/people/emily-flynn), we discovered a surprising sex-specificity in the genetics of testosterone. Yosuke performed polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis and demonstrated that PRS models trained for each sex show improvements in predictive accuracy. Congratulations, Emily!!
