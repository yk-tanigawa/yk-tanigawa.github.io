Yosuke Tanigawa is a Ph.D. candidate in [Biomedical Informatics program](https://med.stanford.edu/bmi.html) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). His research interests are in various topics in population genomics, specifically focusing on the analysis of large-scale datasets.

He works with [Dr. Manuel Rivas](http://med.stanford.edu/rivaslab/) and [Dr. Gill Bejerano](http://bejerano.stanford.edu/).

- 2021/5/11-14: Yosuke will present a poster on "Significant Sparse Polygenic Risk Scores in 428 traits in UK Biobank" at the Biology of Genomes virtual meeting (#poster-324 channel on the conference slack).
- 2021/5/3: **[Yosuke passed his Ph.D. defense](/talks/2021-05-03-PhD-defense)!** Thank you very much for everyone who supported me along the way.
- 2021/4/23: **New Publication** (review article in Japanese). [複数の表現型を用いた人類遺伝統計学の大規模情報解析 (Large-scale human genetic statistical inference with multiple phenotypes)](/publication/2021-04-23-JSBi-review). GWAS、polygenic risk score、高次元データセットでの penalized regression (Lasso など) に関する人類統計遺伝学の解析手法について執筆しました。
- 2021/4/21: Yosuke gave an invited lecture on [Japanese Education](/teaching/2021-04-21-ENGR159Q).
- 2021/1/18: **New Publication**. ["Genetics of 35 blood and urine biomarkers in the UK Biobank"](/publication/2021-01-18-biomarkers). In this project co-led by Nasa Sinnott-Armstrong, myself, and Dr. Manuel A. Rivas, we performed large-scale characterization of the genetic basis of biomarkers and cataloged their influence on diseases. We developed the 'multi-PRS' method and demonstrated its improved ability of disease prediction. Please check out [highlights](/publication/2021-01-18-biomarkers) and the [full texts](https://rdcu.be/cdMmM).
  - 2021/1/29 **Update**: Our paper is featured as [Research highlights in Nature Reviews Nephrology](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41581-021-00400-y)
  - 2021/2/25 **Update**: Our paper is [recommended in Faculty Opinions](https://facultyopinions.com/prime/739382438?key=f7aXbm1AwTY4cdc)
- 2021/2/16: **New Manuscript**. We have a new preprint led by Ruilin Li describing a new version of the R snpnet package and its application to the exome sequencing data in UK Biobank: ["Fast Numerical Optimization for Genome Sequencing Data in Population Biobanks"](/publication/preprint_2021-02-16-snpnet-v2).
- 2021/2/9: **New Publications**. We have two papers from the Rivas lab. Yosuke contributed to each of them as the second author and is very excited to see them published! Congratulations, Matt and Ruilin!
