Yosuke Tanigawa is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Bioengineering](https://www.bioeng.ucla.edu/) at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/).

[**The UCLA Tanigawa Lab is recruiting**](/posts/2025/09/recruiting)!

Yosuke works at the intersection of **statistical genetics** and **computational biology**. Specifically, he develops **computational and statistical methods** to dissect **disease heterogeneity** and apply them in systematic analyses of large-scale phenotypic, genetic, epigenomic, functional genomic, and single-cell genomic datasets.

Before joining UCLA, Yosuke received postdoctoral training at [MIT Computational Biology Lab](http://compbio.mit.edu/) (PI: [Dr. Manolis Kellis](https://web.mit.edu/manoli/)) and completed his doctoral training at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) (Ph.D. in [Biomedical Informatics](https://med.stanford.edu/bmi.html)), working with [Dr. Manuel Rivas](http://med.stanford.edu/rivaslab/) and [Dr. Gill Bejerano](http://bejerano.stanford.edu/).

Please check his [CV](/cv), the [Publications](/publications) page, and his [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9hVh3nQAAAAJ&hl=en). He also maintains the [Resources](/resources) page, where you may browse datasets, analysis and visualization scripts, and web applications from his research activities.
