Yosuke Tanigawa is a Postdoctoral Associate at [MIT Computational Biology Lab](http://compbio.mit.edu/) (PI: [Dr. Manolis Kellis](https://web.mit.edu/manoli/)).

Yosuke works at the intersection of **statistical genetics** and **computational biology**. Specifically, he develops **computational and statistical methods** to dissect **disease heterogeneity** and apply them in systematic analyses of large-scale phenotypic, genetic, epigenomic, functional genomic, and single-cell genomic datasets.

Before joining MIT, he completed his doctoral training at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) (Ph.D. in [Biomedical Informatics](https://med.stanford.edu/bmi.html)), where he worked with [Dr. Manuel Rivas](http://med.stanford.edu/rivaslab/) and [Dr. Gill Bejerano](http://bejerano.stanford.edu/).
