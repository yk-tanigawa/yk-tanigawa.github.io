Yosuke Tanigawa is a Ph.D. candidate in [Biomedical Informatics program](https://med.stanford.edu/bmi.html) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). His research interests are in various topics in population genomics, specifically focusing on analysis of large-scale datasets.

He is currently working with [Dr. Manuel Rivas](http://med.stanford.edu/rivaslab/) and [Dr. Gill Bejerano](http://bejerano.stanford.edu/).

## News

- 20211/1/18: **New Publication**. ["Genetics of 35 blood and urine biomarkers in the UK Biobank"](/publication/2021-01-18-biomarkers). In this project co-led by Nasa Sinnott-Armstrong, myself, and Dr. Manuel A. Rivas, we performed large-scale characterization of the genetic basis of biomarkers and catalogued their influence on diseases. We developed 'multi-PRS' method and demonstrated its improved ability of disease prediction. Please check out [highlights](/publication/2021-01-18-biomarkers) and the [full texts](https://rdcu.be/cdMmM).
  - 2021/1/29 **Update**: Our paper is featured as [Research highlights in Nature Reviews Nephrology](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41581-021-00400-y)
