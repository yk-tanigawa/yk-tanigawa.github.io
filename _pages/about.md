Yosuke Tanigawa is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Bioengineering](https://www.bioeng.ucla.edu/) at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/).

Yosuke is [**presenting and recruiting at ASHG**](/talks/2025-10-14-ASHG2025)!

Yosuke works at the intersection of **statistical genetics** and **computational biology**. Specifically, he develops **computational and statistical methods** to dissect **disease heterogeneity** and apply them in systematic analyses of large-scale phenotypic, genetic, epigenomic, functional genomic, and single-cell genomic datasets.

Before joining UCLA, Yosuke received postdoctoral training at [MIT Computational Biology Lab](http://compbio.mit.edu/) (PI: [Dr. Manolis Kellis](https://web.mit.edu/manoli/)) and completed his doctoral training at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) (Ph.D. in [Biomedical Informatics](https://med.stanford.edu/bmi.html)), working with [Dr. Manuel Rivas](http://med.stanford.edu/rivaslab/) and [Dr. Gill Bejerano](http://bejerano.stanford.edu/).

Please check his [CV](/cv), the [Publications](/publications) page, and his [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9hVh3nQAAAAJ&hl=en). He also maintains the [Resources](/resources) page, where you may browse datasets, analysis and visualization scripts, and web applications from his research activities.

- 2025/9/17-19: Yosuke presented at the [Cell Symposia: Precision genomics for human health](https://www.cell-symposia.com/precision-genomics-2025/index.html)
- 2025/9/4: **New Publication**. Liu\*, Zhang\* et al. "[Single-cell multiregion epigenomic rewiring in Alzheimerâ€™s disease progression and cognitive resilience](/publication/2025-09-04-ad-multiregion-epigenomics)."
- 2025/8/16: **New Preprint**. Zheng et al. "[Disparities and trends in global representation of human genetics conferences: a 26-year longitudinal study of ASHG and ESHG](/publication/preprint-2025-08-16-genetic-conference)." In this study, led by Hao Zheng, we inferred the demography of presenting authors at major genetic conferences and investigated their longitudinal trends across 26 years.
- 2025/7/1: [**Yosuke joined UCLA as an Assistant Professor in Bioengineering**](/posts/2025/07/joining-ucla). My research group will address heterogeneity in disease from computational and statistical perspectives. We will explore the mechanistic basis of interindividual differences in disease onset, progression, and treatment response. There is so much we can do to deliver more relevant prevention and treatment.

"[Cellular and Regional Vulnerability Shapes the Molecular Landscape of Psychosis in Alzheimers Disease](/publication/preprint-2025-05-07-adpsychosis)." In this study jointly led by Matt Victor and Na Sun, we systematically dissect the molecular basis of psychosis in Alzheimer's disease at single-cell resolution, revealing cellular and regional vulnerabilities associated with psychosis.
- 2024/3/27: Yosuke presented at the Department of Computer Sciences, Purdue University.
