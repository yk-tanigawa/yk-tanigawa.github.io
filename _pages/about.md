Yosuke Tanigawa is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Bioengineering](https://www.bioeng.ucla.edu/) at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/).

Yosuke works at the intersection of **statistical genetics** and **computational biology**. Specifically, he develops **computational and statistical methods** to dissect **disease heterogeneity** and apply them in systematic analyses of large-scale phenotypic, genetic, epigenomic, functional genomic, and single-cell genomic datasets.

Before joining UCLA, Yosuke received postdoctoral training at [MIT Computational Biology Lab](http://compbio.mit.edu/) (PI: [Dr. Manolis Kellis](https://web.mit.edu/manoli/)) and completed his doctoral training at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) (Ph.D. in [Biomedical Informatics](https://med.stanford.edu/bmi.html)), working with [Dr. Manuel Rivas](http://med.stanford.edu/rivaslab/) and [Dr. Gill Bejerano](http://bejerano.stanford.edu/).

Please check his [CV](/cv), the [Publications](/publications) page, and his [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9hVh3nQAAAAJ&hl=en). He also maintains the [Resources](/resources) page, where you may browse datasets, analysis and visualization scripts, and web applications from his research activities.

## News

- 2025/7/1: [Yosuke joined UCLA as an **Assistant Professor in Bioengineering**](/posts/2025/07/joining-ucla/). My research group will address heterogeneity in disease from computational and statistical perspectives. We will explore the mechanistic basis of interindividual differences in disease onset, progression, and treatment response. There is so much we can do to deliver more relevant prevention and treatment.
- 2025/2/3: **New Preprint**. Justesen et al. "[Genetics of cardiometabolic disease progression](/publication/preprint-2025-02-03-cardiometabolic-progression)." The colleagues in the Rivas Lab investigate the genetic basis of cardiometabolic disease progression in the UK Biobank. The study shows that the genetic basis of disease progression provides opportunities to stratify individuals, offering substantial implications for guiding treatment decisions.
- 2024/12/17: Yosuke presented at the [Program in Quantitative Genomics Working Group](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/pqg/pqg-working-group-series/), Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health.
