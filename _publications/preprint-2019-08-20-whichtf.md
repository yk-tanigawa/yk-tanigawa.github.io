To identify functionally important transcription factors (TFs), we developed WhichTF. This method takes experimentally characterized chromatin accessibilty measure as the input and returns a ranked list of TFs. We combined available genomic resources, such as gene regulatory domain models, conservation-aware prediction of TF binding sites, and ontology annotation of genes, for this task.
