While many pleiotropic genetic loci have been identified, how they contribute to phenotypes across traits and diseases is unclear.

Here, we propose decomposition of genetic associations (DeGAs), which uses singular value decomposition, to characterize the underlying latent structure of genetic associations of thousands of phenotypes.

When applied to 2,138 phenotypes in UK Biobank, DeGAs captures the correlated structures in genetic associations across multiple phenotypes and multiple variants. With quantitative scores, one can interpret each component.

The latent components can be applied to study the genetics of diseases. We showed applications for three traits, body mass index (BMI), heart attack (MI), and gallstones. We illustrated how to identify the set of phenotypes and variants driving the key component for each trait and the regulatory enrichment of each key component.

When applied to protein-truncating variant dataset, DeGAs prioritizes target for experimental follow-up.

The functional roles of the identified targets (_GPR151_ and _PDE3B_) are demonstrated by experiment.

We provide resource for the research community. We developed [interactive DeGAs web application](https://gbe.stanford.edu/degas) as a part of [Global Biobank Engine](https://gbe.stanford.edu/), whose video tutorial is shown above.

The datasets used in the study are available from figshare.
