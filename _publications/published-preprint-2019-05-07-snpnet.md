excerpt: "In this project led by Junyang Qian, we developed BASIL, a novel algorithm to fit large-scale L1 penalized (Lasso) regression model using an iterative procedure, and implemented R snpnet package specially designed for genetic data. We demonstrate the ability of this approach in an application to UK Biobank dataset."
