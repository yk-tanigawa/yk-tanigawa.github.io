In this study led by [Johanne M. Justesen in the Rivas lab](https://mrivas.su.domains/gbe/people/), we investigate the genetic basis of cardiometabolic disease progression, ascertained by the time from the initial diagnosis to time to complication/comorbidity diagnosed or procedure in the UK Biobank.

Applying the Cox regression model in a time-to-event setting using [snpnet-Cox](/publication/2020-09-29-snpnet-cox), the study shows that the genetic basis of disease progression provides opportunities to stratify individuals using polygenic hazard scores (PHS), offering substantial implications for guiding treatment decisions.
