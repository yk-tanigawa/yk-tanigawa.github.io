In this study led by [Emily Flynn](https://datascience.stanford.edu/people/emily-flynn), we discovered a surprising sex-specificity in the genetics of testosterone. Yosuke performed polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis and demonstrated that PRS models trained for each sex show improvements in predictive accuracy.
