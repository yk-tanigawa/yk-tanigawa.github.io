In this pre-print, we describe a new method to fit a sparse Cox Model for multiple time-to-event phenotypes from large-scale (> 1 million features) genetic dataset.

This study built on other techniques that we've been developping in the Rivas lab with a collaboration with the Hastie and the Tibshirani labs.

  - This manuscript describes a method to obtain the exact solution for large-scale penalized regression model (Lasso). We show several examples using quantitative traits and disease outcomes in UK Biobank.

  - This manuscript describes an extension of BASIL algorithm to Cox model. We show examples using time-to-event phenotypes (onset of diseases) in UK Biobank.
