excerpt: 'Statin is a commonly used drug for high cholesterol. Physicians adjust the type and dose of statin based on the observed response to the treatment. To investigate the role of genetics, we performed genome-wide association scan to identify genetic variants associated with statin selection. When we investigated the identified variants in _LPA_ and _APOE_, we found that the carriers of those variants more likely to be on a higher dose of statin.'

Statin is a commonly used drug for high cholesterol. Physicians adjust the type and dose of statin based on the observed response to the treatment. To investigate the role of genetics, we performed a genome-wide association scan to identify genetic variants associated with statin selection. When we investigated the identified variants in _LPA_ and _APOE_, we found that carriers of those variants are more likely to be on a higher dose of statin.
