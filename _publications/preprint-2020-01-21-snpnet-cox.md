In this study led by [Ruilin Li](https://profiles.stanford.edu/ruilin-li), we propose an extension of BASIL/snpnet alrogirhm to fit L1 penalized Cox proportional hazards model using a large-scale dataset from a genotyped cohort. We present its application to 300+ time-to-event traits in UK Biobank.

Note that this project is a Cox-model extension of [BASIL algorithm](/publication/preprint-2019-05-07-snpnet). Please check the [BASIL/snpnet manuscript](/publication/preprint-2019-05-07-snpnet) for more in-depth discussion on the BASIL algorithm and snpnet package.
