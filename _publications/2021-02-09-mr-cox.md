In this paper, we describe a new method to fit a sparse Cox Model for multiple time-to-event phenotypes from a large-scale (> 1 million features) genetic dataset.

This is a product of collaboration with the Hastie and the Tibshirani labs and built on other techniques that we have developed in the Rivas lab.

  - This manuscript describes a method to obtain the exact solution for a large-scale penalized regression model (Lasso). We show several examples using quantitative traits and disease outcomes in UK Biobank.
