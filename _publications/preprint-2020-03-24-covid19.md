As a part of [the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative](https://covid19hg.netlify.com/), we perform the following set of analyses to better understand the genetic basis of COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.

- Polygenic prediction of blood measurements
- Global catalogue of HLA allelotype diversities
- Global frequency catalogue of ABO blood types

This preprint is a brief description of our activities. We demonstrate the relevance of our genetic resources for analysis of the host genetics of COVID-19.
