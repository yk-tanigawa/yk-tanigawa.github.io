We introduce "hypometric genetics," an approach to investigate the genetic basis of binarized traits representing the presence of below-the-limit-of-quantification (BLQ) quality control indicators. We show a joint analysis of BLQ and quantitative traits leads to improved power in genetic discovery, highlighting the value of considering population-based samples and phenotypic extremes in genetic studies.

## Abstract

Balancing the tradeoff between quantity and quality of phenotypic data is critical in omics studies. Measurements below the limit of quantification (BLQ) are often tagged in quality control fields, but these flags are currently underutilized in human genetics studies. Extreme phenotype sampling is advantageous for mapping rare variant effects. We hypothesize that genetic drivers, along with environmental and technical factors, contribute to the presence of BLQ flags. Here, we introduce “hypometric genetics” (hMG) analysis and uncover a genetic basis for BLQ flags, indicating an additional source of genetic signal for genetic discovery, especially from phenotypic extremes. Applying our hMG approach to n = 227,469 UK Biobank individuals with metabolomic profiles, we reveal more than 5% heritability for BLQ flags and report biologically relevant associations, for example, at APOC3, APOA5, and PDE3B loci. For common variants, polygenic scores trained only for BLQ flags predict the corresponding quantitative traits with 91% accuracy, validating the genetic basis. For rare coding variant associations, we find an asymmetric 65.4% higher enrichment of metabolite-lowering associations for BLQ flags, highlighting the impact of putative loss-of-function variants with large effects on phenotypic extremes. Joint analysis of binarized BLQ flags and the corresponding quantitative metabolite measurements improves power in Bayesian rare variant aggregation tests, resulting in an average of 181% more prioritized genes. Our approach is broadly applicable to omics profiling. Overall, our results underscore the benefit of integrating quality control flags and quantitative measurements and highlight the advantage of joint analysis of population-based samples and phenotypic extremes in human genetics studies.
