From the analysis of more than 500,000 individuals in population cohorts, we identified rare protein-altering variants in _ANGPTL7_ that reduce the risk of glaucoma.

## Highlights

We identified rare protein-altering variants in _ANGPTL7_ that lower intraocular pressure and provide protection against glaucoma.

One of the alleles reported in the study (220C) is highly (50x +) enriched in the Finnish population, highlighting the power of a founder population with a prior bottlenecking event in genetic discovery.

With the comprehensive health information in the two studied cohorts, we assess the potential impact of the rare variants on a spectrum of human disorders. We did not find any severe medical consequences.

Our results indicate that _ANGPTL7_ is a safe and effective therapeutic target for glaucoma.
