From the analysis of more than 500,000 individuals in population cohorts, we identified rare protein-altering variants in _ANGPTL7_ that reduces the risk of glaucoma.

## Highlights

We identified rare protein-altering variants in _ANGPTL7_ that lowers intraocular pressure and povides protection against Glaucoma.

One of the alleles reported in the study (220C) are highly (50x +) enriched in Finnish population, highlighting the power of the founder population with prior a bottlenecking event in genetic discovery.

With the comprehensive health informations in the two studied cohorts, we assess the potential impact of the rare variants on a spectrum of human disorders. We did not find any severe medical consequences.

Taken together, our results indicate that _ANGPTL7_ as a safe and effective therapeutic target for glaucoma.
