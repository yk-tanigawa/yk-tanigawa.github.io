title: "Polygenic risk modeling with latent trait-related genetic components"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-02-08-dPRS
excerpt: 'Polygenic risk score (PRS) has been proposed for disease risk prediction with potential clinical relevance for some traits, but its personalized interpretation is generally difficult, especially when there exist disease subtypes driven by different genetic components. Here, we introduce dPRS (DeGAs-PRS) as an extension of Decomposition of Genetic Associations (DeGAs) to decompose the polygenic risk of individuals into latent components of genetic associations characterized from hundreds of thousands of traits.'

Polygenic risk score (PRS) has been proposed for disease risk prediction with potential clinical relevance for some traits, but its personalized interpretation is generally difficult, especially when there exist disease subtypes driven by different genetic components. Here, we introduce dPRS (DeGAs-PRS) as an extension of Decomposition of Genetic Associations (DeGAs) to decompose the polygenic risk of individuals into latent components of genetic associations characterized from hundreds of thousands of traits.
