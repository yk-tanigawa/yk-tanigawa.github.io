In this study led by [Junyang Qian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/junyang-qian-4a1b3825/), we present a method to fit a sparse multi-variate and multi-response regression model. We demonstrate the application to the UK Biobank biomarker traits, where we investigated the latent structure of regression coefficients using biplot representation.
