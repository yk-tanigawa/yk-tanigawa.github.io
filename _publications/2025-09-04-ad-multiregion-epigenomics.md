## Abstract

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline, yet its epigenetic underpinnings remain elusive. Here, we generate and integrate single-cell epigenomic and transcriptomic profiles of 3.5 million cells from 384 postmortem brain samples across 6 regions in 111 AD and control individuals. We identify over 1 million candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs), organized into 123 regulatory modules across 67 cell subtypes. We define large-scale epigenomic compartments and single-cell epigenomic information and delineate their dynamics in AD, revealing widespread epigenome relaxation and brain-region-specific and cell-type-specific epigenomic erosion signatures during AD progression. These epigenomic stability dynamics are closely associated with cell-type proportion changes, glial cell-state transitions, and coordinated epigenomic and transcriptomic dysregulation linked to AD pathology, cognitive impairment, and cognitive resilience. This study provides critical insights into AD progression and cognitive resilience, presenting a comprehensive single-cell multiomic atlas to advance the understanding of AD.
