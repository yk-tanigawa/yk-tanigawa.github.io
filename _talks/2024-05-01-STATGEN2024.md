The [STATGEN 2024 conference on Statistics in Genomics and Genetics](https://www.sph.pitt.edu/statgen-2024-conference-statistics-genomics-and-genetics) is hosted by the American Statistical Association (ASA) Section on Statistics in Genomics and Genetics (SSGG).
Yosuke presented on a session on Translation and Transferability of Polygenic Risk Scores to Complex Data Scenarios.
