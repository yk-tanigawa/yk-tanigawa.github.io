[Prof. Dr. Andreas Mayr](https://www.imbie.uni-bonn.de/people/prof-dr-andreas-mayr/) kindly invited Yosuke the Institute for Medical Biometry, Informatics and Epidemiology (IMBIE) at University of Bonn.
Yosuke presented his recent works on inclusive polygenic score (iPGS) and multi-PRS.

## Learning objectives

- Summarize recent methodological developments in polygenic score (PGS) research
- Identify the caveats and limitations of existing approaches to PGS analysis of complex traits
- Plan ways to improve the diversity and inclusion in study designs of human genetics studies
- Plan ways to integrate multiple phenotypes in human genetics studies
