I'm excited to present at the online symposium on "Recent Advances in Polygenic Score Modeling," organized by the [IBS-DR working group on Population Genetics and Genome Analysis](https://www.biometrische-gesellschaft.de/en/arbeitsgruppen/population-genetics-and-genome-analysis.html) and the [GMDS](https://www.gmds.de/en/) working group on human genetics.
