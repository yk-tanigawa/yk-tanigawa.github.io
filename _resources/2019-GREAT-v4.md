We performed a major update on Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (version 4) that support human and mouse assemblies (hg38, hg19, and mm10, and mm9). The updated dataset was described and used in [the WhichTF manuscript](/publication/preprint-2019-08-20-whichtf). We also used this dataset in [the DeGAs paper](/publication/2019-09-06-DeGAs).
