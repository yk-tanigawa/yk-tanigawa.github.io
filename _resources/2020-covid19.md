As a part of [the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative](https://covid19hg.netlify.com/), we perform the following set of analyses to better understand the genetic basis of COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.

We performed the following sets of analysis and provided the results as a resource.

- HLA frequency in UK Biobank
- The ABO blood type frequency in UK Biobank
- Polygenic prediction of biomarkers and blood measurements
- PRS_PheWAS: Application of blood measurement PRSs for disease risk prediction
