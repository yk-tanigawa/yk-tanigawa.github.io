# Yosuke's personal website

This is a GitHub repository for [Yosuke's personal website](https://yosuketanigawa.com/). We use [AcademicPages](https://academicpages.github.io/)'s Jekyll template (forked from commit [`25c30de2b4`](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/25c30de2b4ce3e3f23559384699bb4b9865d6473)).

To customize, we use a custom domain from Google Domains and added content.
Some of the content (including the `CV` pdf file) is hosted on Google Drive and embedded into the website with an `iframe`.
