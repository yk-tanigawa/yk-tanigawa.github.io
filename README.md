# Yosuke's personal website

This is a GitHub repository for [Yosuke's presonal website](https://yosuketanigawa.com/). We use [AcademicPages](https://academicpages.github.io/)'s Jekyll template (folked from commit [`25c30de2b4`](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/25c30de2b4ce3e3f23559384699bb4b9865d6473)).

To customize, we use a custom domain from Google Domains and added contents.
Some of the contents (including `CV` pdf file) are hosted on Google Drive and embedded into the website with `iframe`.
