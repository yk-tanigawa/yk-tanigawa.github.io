SLURM is one of the most common job scheduler used in many high performance cluster computing severs (HPC). Here, I summarize useful SLURM commands.

- `sbatch -C "CPU_GEN:HSW|CPU_GEN:BDW|CPU_GEN:SKX"`:
  - AVX2 support started with Haswell on Intel CPUs. To target any CPU generation after Haswell, we can specify constraits assuming that the cluster admin configured those properties in each node.
- `scontrol hold <job ID>`
- `scontrol release <job ID>`
- `scontrol update job <job ID> Dependency=afterany:<previous job ID>`
- `scontrol update job <job ID> JobName="newJobName"`
- `scontrol update job <job ID> partition=<job partitions>`
- `scontrol update job <job ID> MinMemoryCPU=8000`
- `scontrol update job <job ID> TimeLimit=7-00:00:00`
  - You cannot update the time limit of the resource requirements once the job gets started.
- `scontrol show job <job ID>`
- `sacct --starttime 2020-08-01 --`
  - This is useful when checking the job history. Please see [the UBCCR page in reference](https://ubccr.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/5000686909-how-to-retrieve-job-history-and-accounting) for more details.
- `sacct -l -j <job ID>`: show time and memory usage
