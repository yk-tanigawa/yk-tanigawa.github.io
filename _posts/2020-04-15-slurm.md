SLURM is one of the most common job scheduler used in many high performance cluster computing severs (HPC). Here, I summarize useful SLURM commands.

- `sbatch -C "CPU_GEN:HSW|CPU_GEN:BDW|CPU_GEN:SKX"`:
  - AVX2 support started with Haswell on Intel CPUs. To target any CPU generation after Haswell, we can specify constraits assuming that the cluster admin configured those properties in each node.
- `scontrol hold <jid>`
- `scontrol release <jid>`
- `scontrol update job <jid> MinMemoryCPU=8000`
- `scontrol update job <jid> Dependency=afterany:<jid>`
- `scontrol update job <jid> JobName="newJobName"`
- `scontrol update job <jid> partition=<job partitions>`
- `scontrol show job <jid>`
- `sacct --starttime 2020-08-01 --`
  - This is useful when checking the job history. Please see [the UBCCR page in reference](https://ubccr.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/5000686909-how-to-retrieve-job-history-and-accounting) for more details.
