# News (2020)

Thanks to my colleagues and supports from the community, we had several exciting moments in 2020!

- 2020/12/5: Yosuke (virtually) presented at [Japanese San Francisco Bay Area Seminar](http://bayareaseminar.blog42.fc2.com/blog-entry-337.html) regarding his project, titled "Genetics of 35 blood and urine biomarkers in the UK Biobank".
- 2020/11/18-12/2: Yosuke (virtually) presented a poster at [Japanese Society of Human Genetics annual meeting 2020](http://www.congre.co.jp/jshg2020/en/) regarding his project, titled "Sparse polygenic risk scores in hundreds of diseases elucidate their biological basis".
- 2020/11/16-19: Yosuke (virtually) presented a poster at [the RECOMB/ISCB Conference on Regulatory and Systems Genomics with DREAM Challenge](https://www.iscb.org/recomb-regsysgen2020) regarding his project, titled "WhichTF is open in your open chromatin data?".
- 2020/10/27: **New Manuscript**. ["A global atlas of genetic associations of 220 deep phenotypes"](/publication/preprint-2020-10-27-DeGAs-BBJ). In this project co-led by [Saori](https://twitter.com/saorisakaue) and [Masa](https://mkanai.github.io/), we dissected latent DeGAs components of multi-ethnic association summary statistics characterized from both European (UK Biobank and FinnGen) and East Asian (Biobank Japan) populations. We annotated each component by pathway and cell-type enrichment as well as projection of metabolomic and biomarker summary statistics. We demonstrate how can we use such trans-ethnic annotated latent components to classify diseases based on their genetic basis.
- 2020/10/26-30: Yosuke (virtually) presents a poster at American Society of Human Genetics annual meeting 2020.
- 2020/10/23: **New Publication**. ["A fast and scalable framework for large-scale and ultrahigh-dimensional sparse regression with application to the UK Biobank"](/publication/2020-10-23-snpnet). In this project led by [Junyang Qian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zQ1Z5U8AAAAJ), we developed BASIL, a novel algorithm to fit large-scale L1 penalized (Lasso) regression model using an iterative procedure, and implemented R snpnet package specially designed for genetic data. We demonstrate the ability of this approach in an application to UK Biobank dataset. Yosuke contributed to the validation of the method in UK Biobank as well as the development of the software. Congratulations, Junyang!! [Link to the full text](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1009141).
- 2020/9/29: **New Publication**. ["Fast Lasso method for large-scale and ultrahigh-dimensional Cox model with applications to UK Biobank"](/publication/2020-09-29-snpnet-cox). In this study led by [Ruilin Li](https://profiles.stanford.edu/ruilin-li), we propose an extension of BASIL/snpnet alrogirhm to fit L1 penalized Cox proportional hazards model using a large-scale dataset from a genotyped cohort. We present its application to 300+ time-to-event traits in UK Biobank. Congratulations, Ruilin!!

- 2020/9/1: **New Publication**. ["Sex-specific genetic effects across biomarkers"](/publication/2020-09-01-SEMM). In this study led by [Emily Flynn](https://datascience.stanford.edu/people/emily-flynn), we discovered a surprising sex-specificity in the genetics of testosterone. Yosuke performed polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis and demonstrated that PRS models trained for each sex show improvements in predictive accuracy. Congratulations, Emily!!

- 2020/9/1: Yosuke had an oral presentation at [_Informatics in Biology, Medicine, and Pharmacology_ virtual conference (annual meeting of Japanese Society of Bioinformatics)](https://www.jsbi.org/iibmp2020/program/oral.html). [Presentation slides are available here](/talks/2020-09-01-IIBMP2020).
