UCLA Tanigawa Lab (est. 2025) is recruiting! We are part of the [Department of Bioengineering](https://www.bioeng.ucla.edu/) at University of California, Los Angeles.

My research group will address heterogeneity in disease from computational and statistical perspectives. We will explore the mechanistic basis of interindividual differences in disease onset, progression, and treatment response. There is so much we can do to deliver more relevant prevention and treatment.

We are looking for motivated students and postdocs to join the lab. We will post formal job ads soon. Please find me for coffee chat.
