<p>
Are you passionate about using your skills in biomedical data science, statistical modeling, or human genetics to make a real-world impact on human health? The Tanigawa Lab at UCLA is looking for a highly motivated trainees to join our group.
</p>

<p>
We are a new group established in July 2025 in the <a href="https://www.bioeng.ucla.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Bioengineering</a> at the University of California, Los Angeles. As of October 2025, we have 1 PhD student, 1 master student, and 1 undergraduate student in our group.

<h2>What do we work on?</h2>

<p>
Our group investigates <b>disease heterogeneity</b>: why individuals differ in disease onset, progression, and treatment response. We apply computational and statistical approaches to uncover the mechanistic basis of inter-individual variation in the disease, with the long-term goal of providing more tailored prevention and treatment strategies for everyone. We are interested in the following topics:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Computational genomics</b> for disease heterogeneity dissection</li>
  <li><b>Statistical modeling</b> (e.g., predictive modeling on large-scale data and causal inference)</li>
  <li><b>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)</b> investigating disease mechanisms from genetics, single-cell, and multi-omics</li>
  <li>Cross-ancestry <b>polygenic prediction</b> and integration of biological annotations</li>
  <li><b>Therapeutic target discovery</b> and validation from human genomic evidence</li>
</ul>

<h2>We are recruiting multiple positions</h2>

<p>
  We are looking for <b>motivated students and postdocs</b> who are excited to work at the intersection of <b>computational genomics</b>, <b>statistical modeling</b>, and <b>precision medicine</b>. Please see the description below according to your career stage and affiliations.
</p>
