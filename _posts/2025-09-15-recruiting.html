<p>
We are a new group established in July 2025 in the <a href="https://www.bioeng.ucla.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Bioengineering</a> at the University of California, Los Angeles.
</p>

<h2>What do we work on?</h2>

<p>
Our group investigates <b>disease heterogeneity</b>: why individuals differ in disease onset, progression, and treatment response. We apply computational and statistical approaches to uncover the mechanistic basis of inter-individual variation in the disease, with the long-term goal of providing more tailored prevention and treatment strategies for everyone. We are interested in the following topics:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Computational genomics</b> for disease heterogeneity dissection</li>
  <li><b>Statistical modeling</b> (distributional regression of complex traits and causal inference)</li>
  <li><b>AI and Machine learning</b> for investigating disease mechanisms from single-cell & multi-omics</li>
  <li>Cross-ancestry <b>polygenic prediction</b> and integration of biological annotations</li>
  <li><b>Therapeutic target discovery</b> and validation from human genomic evidence</li>
</ul>

<h2>We are recruiting multiple positions</h2>

<p>
  We are looking for <b>motivated students and postdocs</b> who are excited to work at the intersection of <b>computational genomics</b>, <b>statistical modeling</b>, and <b>precision medicine</b>. Please see the description below according to your career stage and affiliations.
</p>


<h3>Postdoctoral Researcher</h3>

<p>
  The Tanigawa Lab has Postdoc openings. Formal job postings will be shared soon. Postdoctoral fellows will work closely with me on interdisciplinary projects on disease heterogeneity dissection. We expect you to have a Ph.D. or equivalent qualification in biomedical data science or a closely related discipline at the date of hire. The start date is flexible. Please <a href="#contact">reach out to me</a>.
</p>

<h3>Prospective PhD students</h3>

<p>
  The Tanigawa Lab has funded PhD opportunities and can accept students through the Bioengineering Department. Please check the eligibility and requirements for the
<a href="https://grad.ucla.edu/programs/school-of-engineering-and-applied-science/bioengineering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Graduate Program in Bioengineering</a> and apply accordingly. I strongly encourage you to <a href="#contact">reach out to me</a> before the application deadline to discuss your motivation, interests, and qualifications.</p>

<p>
  For your graduate training, I will provide necessary mentorship, support, and resources to ensure your professional success. At the same time, I expect students to take the initiative and ownership of their graduate education. I recommend <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62050994-how-to-get-a-phd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"How to Get a PhD" by Phillips and Johnson</a> as a general resource that guides you through the process.
</p>

<h3>PhD students at UCLA</h3>

<p>
  If you are already admitted to a graduate program at UCLA and are interested in working with me on research projects (including <b>laboratory rotation</b>), I'd be glad to meet for coffee on campus to discuss your interests. Please <a href="#contact">reach out to me</a>.
</p>

<h3>Master's and undergraduate students at UCLA</h3>

<p>
  If you are interested in doing research within our lab, please reach out to me, explaining your motivation, interests, and qualifications. Depending on the advising capacity of the lab, we may prioritize students whose background aligns clearly with our research interests. Sometimes, we may advise you to study specific technical aspects in classes before working on research projects. Please <a href="#contact">reach out to me</a>.
</p>

<h3>Research interns and visiting students</h3>

<p>
  In some exceptional cases, the lab will accept research interns and visiting student positions. The preference is given to students/visitors who would like to use the research experience in the lab towards scientific publications. Please <a href="#contact">reach out to me</a>.
</p>

<h2>Where can you learn more about our work?</h2>

<p>
  <b>A mutual fit between the advisor and trainee is critically important</b> to ensure the success of your time in the lab. To that end, I strongly encourage you to consider your long-term career goals, learn about our work, and assess its alignment with your objectives. When we meet, I am happy to learn about your specific interests and discuss how my lab and I can support your professional success.
