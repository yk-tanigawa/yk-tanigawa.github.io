UCLA Tanigawa Lab is recruiting! We are a new group established in July 2025 in the <a href="https://www.bioeng.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Bioengineering</a> at University of California, Los Angeles.

Our group investigates disease heterogeneity: why individuals differ in disease onset, progression, and treatment response. We apply computational and statistical approaches to uncover the mechanistic basis of inter-individual variation in the disease, with the long-term goal of providing more tailored prevention and treatment strategies for everyone.

We are looking for motivated students and postdocs who are excited to work at the intersection of computational genomics, statistical modeling, and precision medicine. 

<h2>Where can you learn more about our work?</h2>

The mutual fit between the advisor and trainee is critically important to ensure the success of your time in the lab. To that end, I strongly encourage you to consider your long-term career goals, learn about our work, and assess its alignment with your objectives. When we meet, I am happy to learn about your specific interests and discuss how my lab and I can support your professional success. You may find out about our research interests in our recent publications and coverage in the news.

<h2>We are recruiting multiple positions.</h2>

Please see the description below according to your career stage and affiliations.

<h3>Postdoctoral Researcher</h3>

The Tanigawa Lab has Postdoc openings. Formal job postings will be shared soon. Postdoctoral fellows will work closely with me on interdisciplinary projects on disease heterogeneity dissection. We expect you to have a Ph.D. or equivalent qualification in biomedical data science or a closely related discipline at the date of hire. The start date is flexible.

<h3>Prospective PhD students</h3>

The Tanigawa Lab has funded PhD opportunities and can accept students through the Bioengineering Department. Please check the eligibility and requirements for the
<a href="https://grad.ucla.edu/programs/school-of-engineering-and-applied-science/bioengineering/" target="_blank">Graduate Program in Bioengineering</a> and apply accordingly. I strongly encourage you to reach out to me before the application deadline to discuss your motivation, interests, and qualifications. I will provide necessary support and mentorship to ensure your professional success as a graduate student. At the same time, I expect students to take the initiative and ownership of their graduate education. I recommend <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62050994-how-to-get-a-phd" target="_blank">"How to Get a PhD" by Phillips and Johnson</a> as a general resource that guides you through the process.

<h3>PhD students at UCLA</h3>

If you are already admitted to a graduate program at UCLA and are interested in working with me on research projects (including laboratory rotation), I would love to chat with you. I'd be glad to meet for coffee on campus to discuss your interests.

<h3>Master's and undergraduate students at UCLA</h3>

If you are interested in doing research within our lab, please reach out to me, explaining your motivation, interests, and qualifications. Depending on the advising capacity of the lab, we may prioritize students whose background aligns clearly with our research interests. Sometimes, we may advise you to study specific technical aspects in classes before working on research projects. 

<h3>Research interns and visiting students</h3>

In some exceptional cases, the lab will accept research interns and visiting student positions. The preference is given to students/visitors who would like to use the research experience in the lab towards scientific publications. 

<h2>Let's get in touch!</h2>

You may find me at the UCLA campus, at conferences, or by email. Please send your email to "tanigawa [at] ucla [dot] edu" and describe your specific interests in joining the lab, and include the most up-to-date version of your resume or CV.
