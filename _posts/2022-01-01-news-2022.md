  - Yosuke was selected as one of the three winners of the Charles J. Epstein Trainee Awards for Excellence in Human Genetics Research! I would like to thank my mentors (former and current), collaborators, and colleagues for their supports.
- 2022/10/4: **New Publication** "[Single-cell dissection of the obesity-exercise axis in adipose-muscle tissues implies a critical role for mesenchymal stem cells](/publication/2022-10-04-scMetab)." Congrats, [Jackie](https://twitter.com/yangjiekun), [Maria](https://twitter.com/MVamvini), [Pasquale](https://twitter.com/PasqualeNigro9), and the team!
- 2022/8/30: **New Publication** "[WhichTF is dominant in your open chromatin data?](/publication/2022-08-30-whichtf)". We develop an ontology-guided approach to ranking tissue-/cell-type-specific transcription factors (TFs) from chromatin accessibility data. This paper describes the last chapter of my Ph.D. thesis, and I am so happy to see this out.
- 2022/8/30: **New Publication** "[Deconvoluting complex correlates of COVID19 severity with a multi-omic pandemic tracking strategy](/publication/2022-08-30-COVIDomics-admixture)". Congrats, Vicki, [Alex](https://ai-page.org/), and the team!
- 2022/7/19: **New Publication**. "[Large-scale multivariate sparse regression with applications to UK Biobank](/publication/2022-07-19-SRRR)." Congrats, [Junyang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/junyang-qian-4a1b3825/) and the team!
- 2022/7/11: Yosuke presented "Single-cell transcriptional hallmarks and patient subtyping for Alzheimer’s disease" at the ROS/MAP meeting 2022 at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL.
- 2022/6/7: Yosuke presented a poster titled "Single-cell transcriptional hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease across 427 individuals" at the Broad Institute Poster Day 2022.
- 2022/6/2: **New Publication**. "[Integration of rare expression outlier-associated variants improves polygenic risk prediction](/publication/2022-06-02-IOGC)." Congrats, [Craig](http://smail-lab.org/) and the team!

- 2022/3/24: **New Publication** "[Significant sparse polygenic risk scores across 813 traits in UK Biobank](/publication/2022-03-24-PRSmap)". We performed a systematic assessment of the predictive performance of polygenic risk score (PRS) models across >1,500 traits in UK Biobank. We reported 813 PRS models with significant predictive performance.
- 2022/03/02: Yosuke [presented polygenic score analyses at University of Osaka, Japan](/talks/2022-03-02-PRS-UOsaka).
