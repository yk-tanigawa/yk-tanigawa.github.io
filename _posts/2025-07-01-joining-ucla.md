I am excited to announce that I have joined UCLA as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Bioengineering](https://www.bioeng.ucla.edu/).

I am incredibly fortunate to have landed my dream job in this current atmosphere. I am grateful for the training and mentorship I received during my postdoctoral training at [MIT Computational Biology Lab](http://compbio.mit.edu/) with [Dr. Manolis Kellis](https://web.mit.edu/manoli/) and my doctoral training at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) with [Dr. Manuel Rivas](http://med.stanford.edu/rivaslab/) and [Dr. Gill Bejerano](http://bejerano.stanford.edu/).

My research group will address heterogeneity in disease from computational and statistical perspectives. We will explore the mechanistic basis of interindividual differences in disease onset, progression, and treatment response. There is so much we can do to deliver more relevant prevention and treatment.
