I'm in the **academic job market** in the 2024/25 cycle. Please reach out if you see a potential alignment.

## Research interests

I am interested in **disease heterogeneity**, i.e. interindividual differences in disease. I will develop computational and statistical approaches to dissect genetic, environmental, and demographic contributors to disease heterogeneity so that everyone receives tailored disease intervention.

Here is a 60-second elevator pitch of my research interests, which I made as a part of [the Fall 2024 EECS Academic Job Search Seminar at MIT](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.9970/).
