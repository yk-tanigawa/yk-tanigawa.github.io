We migrated the website to this new platform.

This website is built with [AcademicPages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) template, which is a folk of [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/) [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) template.

We also set up Google Analytics and Google Search Console.

We host this website via GitHub pages using a cusom domain, which is obtained and managed on Google Domains.

There are several web addresses that I have. All of the followings should be configured to a redirect to this website:

- [http://web.stanford.edu/~ytanigaw](http://web.stanford.edu/~ytanigaw)
- [http://cs.stanford.edu/people/ytanigaw](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/ytanigaw)
- [http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~ytanigaw](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~ytanigaw)
- [http://ai.stanford.edu/~ytanigaw](http://ai.stanford.edu/~ytanigaw)

The [previous website](https://sites.google.com/site/yktanigawa/) is still accessible. We will migrate the contents to the new website.
